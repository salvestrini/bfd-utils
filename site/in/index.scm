(h2 "DESCRIPTION")

(p "DNT is a Development (Note) Tracker with a command line user interface. "
   "It is somewhat similar to "
   (a (@ (href "http://swapoff.org/DevTodo")) "devtodo")
   " with a plugin-oriented design.")
(p "It aims to ease the small/medium projects management tasks (bugs "
   "tracking, feature requests, notes etc) by keeping all the required "
   "information together in the same project's source repository. ")
(p "Being a command line oriented utility it has, as a side-effect, the "
   "ability to automatize the generation of BUGS, NEWS, TODOs etc. files.")
